 -This project is about Income tracking website.
 -The website has been created using Bootstrap, Css and JavaScript.
 -In the homepage on the navbar there is a login button that directs the user to their profile page.
 -In the profile page the user have access to their account where they can 
 state their income by typing a positive value in add transaction form and a negative value to indicate expenses.
 -The first section displays the user's balance, the second section user income and expenses
 and the last section displays the transaction history and a form for entering transactions as they happen.
 -If the user spends more that their stated income their balance become negative indicating they have a credit card debt.
 -The transactions can be many such that they would not fit all in one page and a user can filter the type of transaction 
 they are interested in at the search bar on the right of navbar to get the specific transactions based on their interests.
 -The user can also delete transactions by clicking the red round button on the right of each transaction history. 
 -If the user wants to go back to home page they click the logout button on the navbar and it redirects them back to hompage.# Fat-Wallet
